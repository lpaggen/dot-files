My tmux, nvim, zsh config files

The tmux config includes mappings like ctrl+HJKL to move between tabs, designed to work with neovim. 

Nvim has a couple language servers, everything uses Lazy.nvim package manager. Can use seamlessly with tmux. 

zsh config has a cool theme, and a couple nice plugins like autocomplete etc.
